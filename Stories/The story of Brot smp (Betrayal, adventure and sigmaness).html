<h1>Brot SMP: The story of SDU VS BROTISTAN</h1>
<br><br>
Bobuxstation Simple Dimple had always loved happy Brot SMP Season 1.Aternos.me with its steep, shivering simple dimple tower and brotistan cave. It was a place where he felt happy.

He was an epik, handsome, lava drinker with stronk sussy balls and pro drippy legs. His friends saw him as a pongy, plain pro. Once, he had even helped a roasted server of brot smp season one on aternos.org cross the road. That's the sort of man he was.

Bobuxstation walked over to the window and reflected on his sussy surroundings. The rain hammered like walk cat.

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Pvpmasyer Brotistan. Pvpmasyer was a drippy noob with epik sussy balls and sus drippy legs.

Bobuxstation gulped. He was not prepared for Pvpmasyer.

As Bobuxstation stepped outside and Pvpmasyer came closer, he could see the fair smile on his face.

"I am here because I want destroy simple dimple union," Pvpmasyer bellowed, in a sigma tone. He slammed his fist against Bobuxstation's chest, with the force of 9839 cow. "I frigging hate you, Bobuxstation Simple Dimple."

Bobuxstation looked back, even more sus and still fingering the the eik of Sword. "Pvpmasyer, simple dimple pop it squish," he replied.

They looked at each other with sed feelings, like two depressed, damaged dog walk at a very stronk war, which had Minecraft OST 1 hour lo fi asmr remix music playing in the background and two sussy uncles walk and jumping to the beat.

Suddenly, Pvpmasyer lunged forward and tried to punch Bobuxstation in the face. Quickly, Bobuxstation grabbed the the eik of Sword and brought it down on Pvpmasyer's skull.

Pvpmasyer's epik sussy balls trembled and his sus drippy legs wobbled. He looked epik, his body raw like a bumpy, bloody Balls.

Then he let out an agonising groan and collapsed onto the ground. Moments later Pvpmasyer Brotistan was dead.

Bobuxstation Simple Dimple went back inside and made himself a nice drink of lava.
